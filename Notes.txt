/*----------TYPE CASTING IN JAVA-----------*/
Casting is a process of changing one type value to another type. In Java, we can cast one type of value to another type. It is known as type casting.
Example :
int x = 10;
byte y = (byte)x;
In Java, type casting is classified into two types,
- Widening Casting(Implicit)
    byte->short->int->long->float->double
    -------------------------------->widening
- Narrowing Casting(Explicitly done)
    double->float->long->int->short->byte
    -------------------------------->narrowing

/*----------------JAVA LOOPS----------------*/
Loop is designed to execute its block till the specified condition is true.
Java provides mainly three loop based on the loop structure.
1. for loop-The for loop is used for executing a part of the program repeatedly. When the number of execution is fixed then it is suggested to use for loop. 
2. while loop-Like for loop, while loop is also used to execute code repeatedly. a control statement. It is used for iterating a part of the program several 
   times. When the number of iteration is not fixed then while loop is used.
3. do while loop-In Java, the do-while loop is used to execute statements again and again. This loop executes at least once because the loop is executed 
   before the condition is checked. It means loop condition evaluates after executing of loop body.

/*-NOTE--------The main difference between while and do-while loop is, in do while loop condition evaluates after executing the loop.------------*/
